1. What was the bug?
The (+) operator is using the string function of concatenation instead of the arithmetic addition operation.
2.  How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use)
To fix, I would parse the strings, num1 and num2 into integers first. Then add them and store the sum in result.
